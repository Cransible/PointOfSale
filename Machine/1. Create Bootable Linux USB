# Creating a Bootable Linux USB

I needed a way to get Linux onto the machine and found that creating a bootable Linux USB to be the easiest way.

The steps are relatively simple:
1. Decide on the Linux OS you are going to run and download the ISO file.
2. Use a program to take the ISO and create a bootable USB with it.

## 1. Deciding on the Linux OS and Downloading the ISO File

There are a lot of different versions of Linux that you can run, and I suggest that you decide which version based on your needs.

My needs were as follows:
- Needs to be lightweight to bring life to an old computer.
- Needs to be Windows-like to easily hand off to other people with minimal training.

This led me to **Linux Mint** ([Link to Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)), specifically the **Cinnamon Edition**.

The minimum requirements were in line with what my machine had, and it was Windows-like enough to allow anyone to open a program easily and quickly with minimal training.

Follow the OS provider's advice when downloading the ISO, and choose it from a mirror server that is close to you for better speeds.

## 2. Using a Program to Create the Bootable USB

Most guides that I found while researching this recommended using **BalenaEtcher** to create the bootable USB. However, I went down a rabbit hole trying to decide which program was best, and **Rufus** came up multiple times. I wasn’t sure if there was much difference, or if it was mostly based on preference.

What I found is that **Rufus** is generally considered lighter weight and more capable.

Additionally, I found a random Reddit thread suggesting that **BalenaEtcher** might have spyware loaded after 2024. Given this, I decided to go with **Rufus** ([Link to Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)).

Just download it, and it runs quickly.

### To Make the Bootable Drive:

1. Plug in a USB drive that you are willing to sacrifice for this task. (The USB will be reformatted, so any data on there should be backed up before you start).
2. Make sure the ISO file is downloaded and saved in an easily accessible folder (e.g., Downloads).
3. Start the **Rufus** program and follow the prompts to create the bootable drive.  
    - The most important information you need to provide is:
        - **Device**: The USB you want to make into the bootable device.
        - **Boot Selection**: The ISO file you want to load onto it.
4. Let the program run, and voilà, you now have a bootable device!

### Final Steps:

- Eject the USB drive properly to avoid corrupting anything.
- Plug it into the machine you want to convert to Linux.
