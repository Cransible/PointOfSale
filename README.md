# PointOfSale

The point of sale project is to make a simple point of sale system to track inventory. This is not a fully functioning point of sale that tracks customers and purchases and money. It was built to assist with non profit, free store, inventory management. 

Problem Statement: 
A small organization is runing a free store where it gives out items every month. Items are donated to the organization and there are common items that must be available each month. 

The org is tracking inventory using google docs and hand counting inventory before the store opens, and after the store closes. 

The act of counting inventory after the store closes is cumbersome and inacurate. 

Further, it is dificult for the organization to put out a call for donations to the community as it is difficult to know what items are running low, as well as understanding what trends there are in purchases. 

The org wants something to assist with managing the inventory, as well as give them trend data so that they can prioritize high need items during their call for donations. 


Solution: 
Create a simple point of sale system that tracks inventory as it is "purchased". 

3 key features: 
1. Tracking of sales (out)
2. Tracking of inventory/donations recieved (in)
3. Management of inventory levels, and analysing trends


Proposed Course of Action: 
1. Use an old laptop to act as the machine to host the solution
2. Create a simple python Flask Program to act as the point of sale
3. Integrate Barcode scanning to track inventory




I have split the repository into 2 sections: 
1. Machine - where I walk through my process to create the machine
2. Python App - where I have all my python code and Flask Framework
3. Barcode Integration - where I talk about decsions around barcoding and working with the barcode scanners we purchsed
