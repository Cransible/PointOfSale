# Machine

This section contains all the information about the machine I am using to run this solution as well as what I did to set it up.

This solution was going to be brought to many different locations, and so we decided to use an old laptop to run the program. Unfortunately, the donated laptop was quite old and could barely run the version of Windows it had loaded on it.

I decided to load Linux onto it with the hope that a lighter-weight operating system would allow for the laptop to function for longer. The drawback of this was that if someone unfamiliar with Linux used it, say a volunteer, it would be difficult for them to use.

This is why I chose to go with a Linux OS that was more similar to Windows, in the attempt that it would be close enough that there wouldn't be major problems.

## Linux Mint OS:
- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
- **Cinnamon Edition**
- Version: **Linux Mint 22.1 Cinnamon**
- Kernel: **6.4.8**
- OS Version: **6.8.0-51-generic**

This version was within the spec range of the computer that I had, and was close enough to a Windows-like OS that I was confident most people could learn it quickly.

### The Computer:
The computer that was donated was an old **Dell Vostro 14 3000**. It is a laptop that was a few years old but was never very powerful to begin with. The main issue with it was the low RAM. It had 4GB of memory that was being used up by the Windows OS and a single Chrome tab. I was unable to use the laptop at the time to do the Linux conversion on itself.

## Computer Specs:
- **Model:** Dell Vostro 14 3000
- **Processor:** 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i3-1115G4 @ 3.00GHz × 2
- **Memory:** 4 GiB
- **Storage:** 1TB HDD
- **Graphics:** Intel Corporation Tiger Lake-LP GT2 [UHD Graphics G4]

I don't know a lot more about it because I wiped it and put Linux on it before I started thinking about writing up this project.
